# `05.1` Loop an array

In this exercise you will be looping an array from scratch. If you need a refresher, please take 6 minutes to watch this video on [how to loop an array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24Wpg6njlYI).

## üìù Instructions:

The code right now is printing the first item in the console. 

Instead of doing that:

1. Print all the elements in the array. Iterate through the whole array using a loop.

## üí° Hints:

+ Remember that to access the value of a position you have to use the index `(myArray[index])`.

+ [Here is a cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24Wpg6njlYI) explaining how to use the `for` loop to loop arrays.

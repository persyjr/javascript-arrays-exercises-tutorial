1. Add 10 random integers to the `arr` list and print the array on the console.

## 💡 Hints:

+ You can google "How to loop 10 times in javascript".

+ Here is a [great result from google](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45024991/run-a-loop-n-times).

+ You can use the `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` functions to get random numbers, you should do that inside the loop.

+ On each loop iteration you have to use the `.push(item)` function to add the new random number to the array.
